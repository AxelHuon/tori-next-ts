\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIOUTPUT\fR [default: {title}.mkv]
Name of the output file. If you use one of the following pattern they will get replaced:
  {title}                    → Title of the video
  {series_name}              → Name of the series
  {season_name}              → Name of the season
  {audio}                    → Audio language of the video
  {resolution}               → Resolution of the video
  {season_number}            → Number of the season
  {episode_number}           → Number of the episode
  {relative_episode_number}  → Number of the episode relative to its season
  {sequence_number}          → Like \*(Aq{episode_number}\*(Aq but without possible non\-number characters
  {relative_sequence_number} → Like \*(Aq{relative_episode_number}\*(Aq but with support for episode 0\*(Aqs and .5\*(Aqs
  {series_id}                → ID of the series
  {season_id}                → ID of the season
  {episode_id}               → ID of the episode
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-specials\fR=\fIOUTPUT_SPECIALS\fR
Name of the output file if the episode is a special. If not set, the \*(Aq\-o\*(Aq/\*(Aq\-\-output\*(Aq flag will be used as name template
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-resolution\fR=\fIRESOLUTION\fR [default: best]
The video resolution. Can either be specified via the pixels (e.g. 1920x1080), the abbreviation for pixels (e.g. 1080p) or \*(Aqcommon\-use\*(Aq words (e.g. best). Specifying the exact pixels is not recommended, use one of the other options instead. Crunchyroll let you choose the quality with pixel abbreviation on their clients, so you might be already familiar with the available options. The available common\-use words are \*(Aqbest\*(Aq (choose the best resolution available) and \*(Aqworst\*(Aq (worst resolution available)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-merge\fR=\fIMERGE\fR [default: auto]
Because of local restrictions (or other reasons) some episodes with different languages does not have the same length (e.g. when some scenes were cut out). With this flag you can set the behavior when handling multiple language.
    Valid options are \*(Aqaudio\*(Aq (stores one video and all other languages as audio only), \*(Aqvideo\*(Aq (stores the video + audio for every language) and \*(Aqauto\*(Aq (detects if videos differ in length: if so, behave like \*(Aqvideo\*(Aq else like \*(Aqaudio\*(Aq)
.TP
